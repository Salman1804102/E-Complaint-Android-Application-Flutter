# E-Vigilant: An e-commerce assistant smartphone application with customer and seller fraud detection, seller identity check, legal help, e-shopping features

An innovative mobile application (thesis project) in Flutter.

## Abstract
Ecommerce or online shopping is popular all over the world due to increased internet and smartphone usage, convenience, easy access to product and seller information, reduced
communication difficulties, and changing consumer behaviors. The previous literary works on ecommerce assistants did not offer adequate support to both customers and sellers. This was due to the absence of an automated application that could predict customer and seller fraud, submit electronic complaints, search for legal help, and provide options for verifying the identity of sellers, products, and customers. To rectify the existing concerns, this paper exhibits an ecommerce assistant smartphone application that includes customer and seller side fraud prediction, seller, customer, and product identity checks, electronic complaint against fraud, legal help search, customer choice-based e-shopping feature, seller contact, inquiry, loan application for sellers, ecommerce tips, and seller review submission features. The app success measurement and fruitfulness investigation results revealed that more than 57% of investigators supported the proposed application with excellent feedback.
